Create a beautiful 3D unicorn model suitable for ${theme} themed interactive 3D environment.

Requirements:
- 3D model format: GLB (optimized for web)
- Polygon count: 5,000-15,000 triangles
- Texture resolution: 1024x1024 to 2048x2048
- PBR materials with proper UV mapping
- Rigged for basic animations (idle, walk, head movement)

Theme-specific characteristics for ${theme}:
- Fantasy: Classic unicorn with pristine white coat, silver horn, flowing mane, magical aura
- Sci-fi: Futuristic unicorn with metallic elements, glowing horn, digital mane effects
- Nature: Earth-toned unicorn with natural horn, organic textures, flower decorations

Physical characteristics:
- Proportions: Elegant horse-like body with unicorn features
- Horn: Spiraled, positioned center of forehead
- Mane and tail: Flowing, dynamic, suitable for animation
- Eyes: Expressive, large, with appropriate material properties
- Hooves: Detailed, appropriate to theme

Technical specifications:
- Geometry: Clean topology, quad-based where possible
- Materials: PBR workflow (Albedo, Normal, Metallic, Roughness)
- Textures: High quality, optimized for real-time rendering
- UV mapping: Efficient, minimal seams
- LOD ready: Suitable for distance-based optimization

Animation considerations:
- Bone structure: Standard quadruped rig
- Key poses: Standing, walking, head turns, tail swish
- Breathing: Subtle chest movement for idle state
- Mane physics: Suitable for cloth/hair simulation

The unicorn should be the focal point of the 3D scene, majestic and interactive, fitting naturally within the panoramic background environment.
